# Blockai

## TL;DR Story 
* We launched [QuickCoin](http://www.quickcoin.co) late last May as an experiment in making bitcoin simple and spread it around the world. It was the first bitcoin wallet with identity. 
* It was loved for a brief point in time, then died a horrible death. 
* We've silently been building our next product -- with the potential to revolutionize publishing and digital ownership. 

### Today, we're excited to announce the public beta of our next product. [Blockai](https://www.blockai.com), "The Netscape of the Blockchain". 
* We see the blockchain as an entirely new medium, just like the Internet, TV and Radio before it.
* It's the world's first reliable public database. A public space that no single company or government controls. 
* Blockai is a universal blockchain browser and publishing tool.  
* A single application for using the best protocols of the blockchain. Instead of having to use different logins and wallets and find all of the different apps, you can now do it all from Blockai with a single identity and wallet.
* The same way Netscape showed the world what it means to use the web and built open-source technologies to support its growthâ€” we are doing the same for the blockchain. 
* Our first open-source protocols are [Blockcast](https://github.com/williamcotton/blockcast)(text)
* and in time for Valentine's Day, [Proof of Love](https://github.com/blockai/proof-of-love). **_"Diamonds aren't forever. Blockchain is."_**
* _We believe that by giving people more ways to use the blockchain and bringing order to chaos, Blockai will help spread bitcoin and start building real sustainable value for us all._

## Long Story 
### Once upon a time...
It all started at the beginning of 2014, talking about the future of bitcoin and the blockchain over ramen and beer in Japan Town. Crazy ideas were thrown around by how bitcoin could change every aspect of the world. Some ideas were great. Some ideas, not so much.

One thing that seemed clear was that as long as bitcoin survived this would be the start of a digital ownership revolution that would reshape not only money -- but publishing, music, movies, gaming and so much more. And not reshape in a temporary way. Reshape in a way that could last for all time-- beyond even the internet as we know it today. 

We knew we had to do something to be a part of it and help bitcoin spread to reach its potential. 

As a first step, we created an event called "The Bitcoin Fair" at [Ramen Underground](http://www.ramenunderground.com/location/japantown), since it was the place where the company began. The theme was for both experts and non-experts to come out and talk about bitcoin and to use bitcoin to purchase food; specifically Ramen, Chicken Karaage and Beer. 

<p align="center"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/AYaz8HZ.gif" alt="Bitcoin Fair"></p>

We put together the whole thing in 10 days of intense work. It went awesome, altho definitely had some logistics issues. Luckily people came and went, because the space only fit about 60. 

Some stats:

* Over 250 people were in attendance, ranging from hard-core bitcoiners to elderly couples and Silicon Valley CEOs and VCs.  
* 2 TV crews.
* 5 journalists. 
* Roughly ~$120 in bitcoin sales...

A big problem that became obvious at the Bitcoin Fair was that it insanely painful to use bitcoin. Also, people had no real reason to use it.. most just paid with cash. One waitress got so stressed from the experience she almost cried, despite us having trained them on how it all worked. Shit wasn't easy. 

Also, we experienced the big public perception problem right in our face. Someone outside the restaurant yelled "money Laundering" because we had the Bitcoin logo on the window. Also, Japan Town mall management asked us questions about it.

____

Peter Shiau from Standard Chartered Bank(old world British Oil bank..) was in attendance. We told him our idea for an application to make bitcoin more friendly and easier to spread, to solve some of the immediate problems we had seen that were limiting bitcoin from spreading. He offered to let us stay at their shared office space for 6+ months since he thought what we were building was cool and the bank might even be interested in investing at some point. It was a bit creepy to have an old bank invite us to their office, but it was in South Park.. a spot that's super expensive and next to 21st Amendment, one of our favorite meetup spots. And it was free. We said yes.

<p align="center"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/G1JX3S5.jpg" alt="QuickCoin Office"></p>

____

We then began building QuickCoin, "Bitcoin Made Simple", with the initial goal being to build an easier to use bitcoin wallet, that would make bitcoin seem more friendly to regular people, and would help bitcoin spread by dramatically reducing the steps necessary to send to a friend. 

At the time, there were just 2 of us, me(a gaming entrepeneur with basic web skills but much more experienced in business) and our other partner, who was a well known bitcoin trader but didn't have any technical skills. I could build basic websites, but nothing on the scale of the type of hard-core engineering we'd need.

I started reaching out to my network of engineers I trusted and had known for a few years and ended up setting up a brunch with Paul McKellar, a friend most known for being the first engineer at Square. He told me that I needed to talk with [William Cotton](http://www.linkedin.com/in/williamcotton), one of the best engineers he knew.

We contacted William and met up at 21st Amendment in South Park. He showed up wearing the only bitcoin to his name around his neck. Like most of the best engineers out there, he had kind of written off bitcoin and hadn't dived deep into the blockchain, because well.. most people hate bankers and finance. We offered to pay him to work on a prototype. He came back a week later and was mindblown by what all the blockchain would enable in the future. We offered to be equal partners. 

While William was building the product, we worked on continuining to engage with the community as much as possible. We were introduced to Pamir Gelenbe who was preparing to do the CoinSummit  in San Francisco. We became a Media Sponsor for the summit and I helped promote it as well as got Fast Company to live blog the event.

<p align="center"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/wAcQdD9.gif" alt="Coin Summit"></p>

Then, we participated in 2 charity events with "HackCancer", as another experiment with cryptocurrency. We wanted to see if people would use bitcoin for donations, and if it could actually help extend real-world fundraising efforts by also allowing people to easily donate online as well. The experiment was pretty much a failure. At the event, one of the VCs on stage(that was playing in a band) basically made fun of bitcoin and seemed pretty oblivious to what it actually was.. so yeah, that didn't help.  

<p align="center"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Mo60seP.gif" alt="Hack Cancer"></p>

William and I also spent time on helping with what turned out to be a very poorly planned documentary for the #1 Korean Television station, KBS. After talking with them, doing video interviews and touring them around San Francisco using bitcoin, it became apparent they didn't really get bitcoin or the blockchain. The documentary was never aired. 
____

Next we decided we wanted to make a cool, light hearted video to show off QuickCoin when we launched, to further re-inforce the friendly image of bitcoin to regular people. My buddy(and now advisor) Niero, the creator of popular gaming site [Destructoid](http://www.destructoid.com/), introduced us to a great guy named Sean Brown @ [Video Purveyor](http://videopurveyor.com/) who happened to be next door to our office. We were able to just walk over, sit on the couch, and make a pretty cool video to explain QuickCoin...

<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/94730113" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/94730113">Introducing QuickCoin</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user27871849">QuickCoin</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

Then we launched QuickCoin V0.1. It was loved. It got a lot of media attention to, landing on the top of Reddit/r/bitcoin 3 times, top of Reddit/r/dogecoin once, and coverage by [PandoDaily](http://pando.com/2014/05/26/san-franciscos-quickcoin-bitcoin-so-simple-even-mom-can-use-it/) and many others. 

<p align="center"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/d4vh1lk.jpg" alt="QuickCoin V0.1"></p>

Investors contacted us, chased us, and even said things like "we'll invest no matter the terms as long as there is a cap on your note!". It was pretty rediculous. 

Then we got rich and danced in money...

<p align="center"><img src="http://media.giphy.com/media/plrhd7RveGGZy/giphy.gif" alt="Money Dance"></p>

Well.. okay, so that didn't really happen.

A few launch stats:
* Over $150,000 worth of bitcoin sent via the Facebook API in just 10 days. 
* Over 10,000 users signed up. 
* 3:10 Average usage duration.

Then, things got serious. Major disagreements were had and hard decisions had to be made. Our team went from 3 to 2. It was painful and difficult for all, but we knew it was for the best for all involved and for the future strength of the company. 

We decided instead of raising money from investors for a product we weren't convinced would really be the future, we'd be keep self-financing the company, bootstrapping and taking what we had built and learned and turning int into something that would really take things to the next level of providing value, giving people a way to use bitcoin and helping it spread. 

As part of our focus on thinking very long term, we brought on a great group of [advisors](http://quickcoin.co/about#advisors) to give us a solid foundation for the future. We brought in friends & people we respected from major technology companies and gaming companies. People like Zach Klein(Vimeo), Don Dodge(Google), Paul McKellar(Square), Kai Huang(Guitar Hero) and Kevin Chou(Kabam). 

We worked on the next version of QuickCoin, with a more native feel for the HTML5 Mobile version.
<p align="center"><img src="http://quickcoin2" alt="QuickCoin V2.0"></p>

and then... traffic died off. hard. 

<p align="center"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/xCSTn0E.jpg" alt="QuickCoin Chart"></p>

We have a few theories about why it failed. 

1. there is nothing to do with bitcoin. 
2. the mainstream isn't ready for bitcoin. 
3. the act of sending bitcoin to someone who doesn't know anything about it, without any purpose, is very awkward and results in a dead end viral loop.

That in combination with the fact that we didn't personally think a bitcoin wallet was inspiring to work on, as well as the Facebook API was changing so we'd have to change anyways. 

We beat our heads against the wall a bit, then got back to work. We soul searched and thought long and hard about what fundamentally had interested us in bitcoin in the first place. We kept coming back to the idea of bitcoin being this freeing thing. The more and more we thought about it, we realized that the blockchain could be used for so much more than it is today.

It's the first public database ever.A public space that the people of the world own, that can be used for freedom of speech, to immortalize our thoughts, and to create a real layer for publishing, monetization and digital ownership. 

We then began working on the new thing. After speaking in Vegas at "Inside Bitcoins" and having several drinks, we came up with the name "Quick"...stemmed from us not liking the QuickCoin name. We felt like it sounded cheap and also got confused as an alt currency. 

Our first concept for what QuickCoin would evolve into was a de-centralized social network using the blockchain.

<p align="center"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Sjc75Fh.jpg" alt="Quick"></p>

Pretty cool idea. But too mainstream, too soon, and it wouldn't do much to help the entire bitcoin ecosystem.

William was very passionate about open-source and was adamant about building a real software company that solved real problems, not just building some "cute app" that investors would foolishly like. 

Then, we realized that there was no easy way to browse and use the blockchain. The state of applications and protocols on the blockchain was a nightmare. A lot of brilliant young kids building cool things, but with no environment to bring things together and give people a place to play with it all in a way that made sense. We realized the kind of application we wanted to build, there was no existing infrastructure to support it. 

Then, in the shower I came up with the name Blockai with the idea being that the blockchain is like this amazing "God Stream" that will exist forever, and we're the eye into that world. 

In Japanese, when they use the English word for "Eye", they spell it "ai". Also, in Chinese "Kai" means to unlock/unleash. Both fit perfectly with what we're aspiring to do so it was an obvious decision. Plus, suprisingly the domain was available. :)

WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT..... HISTORY...

The Blockchain is a new medium. Just like the radio, television and internet before it -- the blockchain is a new thing. A de-centralized space for recording history, proving digital ownership and faciliating transactions of all kinds. 

Blockai was born. Surprisingly, no one owned the domain. Woo!

I created the first logo in Keynote, with the goal of making a simple logo with an eye shape in a box... thought it was pretty decent. Someone called it a donut in a box. I realized they were right. 

<p align="center"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Iit7wv4.png" alt="Blockai First Logo"></p>

We wanted something more fun. As a kid, the logo for Netscape was truly inspiring with the iconic N and stars. The internet was like this new world, and Netscape was the ship you were taking to get there. Something like Never Never Land but better. We felt like we wanted to inspire that same feeling because well, the Blockchain really is a new world to visit. 

William threw up a temporary logo that was a bit more inspiring and adequately represented the raw and primitve state of the blockchain. We're not sure if we'll keep it, modify it or do something completely different.. but it's actually started to grow on us so we're going to use it and see what happens. :) 

<p align="center"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/bm9liWp.png" alt="Blockai Logo"></p>

We believe in the future this will be xyz. 

We plan to make money by charging a small fee for the convenience factor of using everything from a single browser. We don't believe that purely open-source, or purely closed-source are right for us. We believe that a hybrid model where we open-source most of the technology, but keep a few things like the product proprietary. 

In the future, we may also create new products on top of Blockai that help support our business and goals in order to create a sustainable business that can . So, from a business standpoint, basically Netscape but with better economics because we have a wallet built right in. That way we're never in a position of needing to put stupid shit in the browser, like Netscape had to do. Then they had to go purely open-source which led to them being overtaken by Google Chrome and others. :)

We realize that this may upset some people. XYZ reason why okay.

Just like how the internet brought poets, artists and other people into the internet, the Blockchain is a creative space that is going to unlock people's passions and inspire imaginations around the world. 

In the following days, William will be writing a blog post with more of a technical focus on why we're doing this and what we're building. 

Thank you all, we look forward to building the best experience possible for the blockchain and helping show the world what it's all about!

We believe that people should own their data and identity. We also believe that we can build a good sustainable business and appreciate your support. 

A new era is starting. A future where the blockchain acts as a public space on the web that no single company or country owns. A place where we creators can create, and where people can be heard, where things that are earned can be actually owned and used however you want, wherever you want, and where people can be fairly compensated for what they've built. A better future. 


Sincerely,

Nathan Lands & William Cotton
